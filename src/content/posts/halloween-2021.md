**We hope the kids had a spooky time this year at our Halloween event. Thank you to everyone who joined us, and participated on activities filled with mummy wrapping, pumpkin painting, musical chairs, and more! We loved seeing everyone's costume from Pikachu to Zombie chef to skeletons and even Frida Kahlo. Be sure to join us again next year for more Halloween tricks and treats!** ðŸŽƒðŸ‘»ðŸ’€
